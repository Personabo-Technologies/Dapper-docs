## Introduction

<div>

At Dapper Labs, we are truly excited about the potential for Web3 to
usher in a new digital ownership economy, with an opportunity to create
a massive wave of network effects.

</div>

<div>

Web3 encapsulates all of the underlying blockchain technology that
enables a new way of looking at web applications, going beyond the
centralized platform management of today's organizations to the publicly
verifiable ownership of digital assets. The ownership and portability of
digital assets is made independent of centralized entities by locating
those assets on decentralized blockchains. This model further encourages
composability by identifying reusable primitives that can be publicly
leveraged by any project, instead of siloed systems existing inside of
private entities.

</div>

<div>

That's why we created Dapper, a product of Dapper Labs. Dapper enables
developers to quickly build amazing Web3 products at mainstream scale,
accessing the largest Web3 community. Our secure wallet with verified
apps increases the trust and safety of the end user enabling anyone to
comfortably, conveniently and confidently participate in Web3.

## The Web3 Stack

<div>

Building a Web3 Application with Dapper involves understanding of each
of the technologies in the following stack:

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

-   **Flow Client Library (FCL):** Provides convenient access to the
    Flow Blockchain including wallet authentication, querying and
    mutations.
-   **Dapper Wallet:** Acts as the gateway for the user to approve for
    all transactions. Only verified transactions are allowed, and
    transactions presented in plain-english so users know what the
    transactions are doing.
-   **Dapper Platform:** Provides the core functionality behind the
    Dapper Wallet. Developer contracts and transactions are registered
    with the platform, providing access to users in the Dapper
    ecosystem.
-   **Back-end Services:** All off-chain services required to create a
    rich user experience. This includes databases, media gateways,
    analytic services, logging, etc. The backend services can also
    interact directly with Flow through FCL.
-   **Client Application:** Provides either a web or mobile user
    interface and uses a combination of calls to the Flow blockchain via
    FCL and calls to back-end services. Interactions with the blockchain
    can be done directly from the client, or via back-end APIs depending
    on the application architecture.
-   **Flow Blockchain:** The blockchain underlying the entire ecosystem.
    All contracts and accounts exist on-chain, and all transactions are
    recorded on-chain.

## Dapper Platform

<div>

Dapper Platform provides developers access to a premier ecosystem of
web3 products and Dapper Wallet's key functionality. This includes:

</div>

-   **Identity:** Easily onboard customers in a matter of seconds.
-   **Checkout:** Provide a seamless purchase experience for all your
    customers.
-   **Custody:** Users can safely store and share their digital
    collectibles.
-   **Airdrops:** Reward customers with things they love.
-   **Fungible Tokens:** Issue, distribute, and transact in arbitrary
    tokens.

<div>

Dapper Platform leverages the Flow Blockchain to provide a safe and
secure ecosystem for users, from the blockchain layer all the way up to
the user experience at the application level.

## Flow Blockchain

<div>

Flow is an environmentally friendly, fully decentralized blockchain that
is built to put users first with:

</div>

-   Minimal transaction fees
-   Fast deterministic finality
-   Human readable messages
-   Secure Account Recovery flows
-   Upgradeable Smart Contracts
-   Built in logging support

### Cadence

<div>

Cadence is a new smart contract programming language for use on the Flow
Blockchain. Cadence introduces new features to smart contract
programming that help developers ensure that their code is safe, secure,
clear, and approachable. Some of these features are:

</div>

-   Type safety and a strong static type system
-   Resource-oriented programming, a new paradigm that pairs linear
    types with object capabilities to create a secure and declarative
    model for digital ownership by ensuring that resources (and their
    associated assets) can only exist in one location at a time, cannot
    be copied, and cannot be accidentally lost or deleted
-   Built-in pre-conditions and post-conditions for functions
    andÂ transactions
-   The utilization of capability-based security, which enforces access
    control by requiring that access to objects is restricted to only
    the owner and those who have a valid reference to the object

<div>

Resource-oriented programming, and by extension Cadence, is the perfect
programming environment for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), because users
are able to store their NFT objects directly in their accounts and
transact peer-to-peer. Please see theÂ blog post about resourcesÂ to
understand why they are perfect for digital collectibles such as NBA Top
Shot or NFL All Day Moments.

## Dapper Wallet

<div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

Dapper Wallet allows users to pay using fiat or cryptocurrencies.

</div>

<div>

Every Dapper user has a "Dapper Balance" that represents a USD
denominated balance and any on-chain transactions are done internally
using utility tokens called DUC (Dapper Utility Coin that represents
USD) and FUT (Flow Utility Token that represents Flow). These tokens are
purely on-chain accounting tokens.

</div>

<div>

Users can off-ramp their "Dapper Balance" using various methods
depending on their jurisdiction. This includes Automated Clearing House
(ACH) Transfers in the US, Wire Withdrawals in the US, Canada & UK, and
USDC stable coins on Flow or Ethereum internationally.

</div>

<div>

Dapper Wallet users can buy NFTs from other users or other dApps
integrated with Dapper Wallet.
